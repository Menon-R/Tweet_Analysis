# Tweet analysis
A project on analysing extracted tweets - (Scraped using Twint). For this project I chose to extract tweets about the supermarket gaint Coles during the period of March -2020, when Australia was at it's peak on COVID - 19 cases and when the supermarket shelves were empty due to high demand of products as people feared a lockdown.
